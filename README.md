# Automated Teeth Disease Detection Using Deep Learning

## 1. Introduction

This project focuses on automating the classification of teeth diseases from images using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The motivation stems from the fact that manual classification by medical professionals is often time-consuming and prone to errors. Automated image classification, leveraging CNNs, can significantly assist medical professionals in achieving faster diagnoses.

## 2. Problem Statement

The primary goal of this project is to develop a CNN model capable of accurately classifying teeth diseases from images into one of seven distinct categories:
* OC (Oral Cancer)
* CaS (Caries)
* OT (Other Types)
* CoS (Cosmetic Issues)
* Gum (Gum Disease)
* MC (Molar Conditions)
* OLP (Oral Lichen Planus)

## 3. Dataset Description

The dataset used for this project is organized into three main subsets:
* **Training Set:** Used to train the model.
* **Validation Set:** Used for hyperparameter tuning and performance monitoring during training.
* **Testing Set:** Used for the final evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data.

The dataset follows a specific hierarchy:
